# CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks with test datasets


## CNN with Pytorch - Medical Image Diagnosis (2 classes)

Dataset downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paulti/chest-xray-images
5,856 chest X-ray images of patients with and without pneumonia; 2 classes Normal (1,342) and Pneumonia (4,514), of size 1024*1024

Because CUDA is not available for download on a MacOS system anymore, I used Google Colab since it already has the CUDA toolkit and drivers installed on its virtual machines


## CNN with Tensorflow - Traffic sign classification (43 classes)

Dataset downloaded from: https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2023/x/projects/5/traffic.zip
