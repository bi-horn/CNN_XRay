### Application of an AI System for Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images

Dataset downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paulti/chest-xray-images
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3
5,856 chest X-ray images of patients with and without pneumonia; 2 classes Normal (1,582) and Pneumonia (4,273), of size 1024*1024

Because CUDA is not available for download on a MacOS system anymore, I used Google Colab since it already has the CUDA toolkit and drivers installed on its virtual machines

I tested ResNet18 but also a simpler self-defined neural network on that dataset
